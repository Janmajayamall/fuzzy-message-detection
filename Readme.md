# Fuzzy message detection

This repository implements FMD2 scheme from [Fuzzy message detection](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/089.pdf) paper. The aim is to learn and play around with implementation to understand the scheme at deeper level.

In coming days implementation of FracFMD will also be added. I also plan to test the two schemes under different simulated scenarios taking inspiration from [fuzzytags-sim](https://git.openprivacy.ca/openprivacy/fuzzytags-sim) and [fuzzytags](https://git.openprivacy.ca/openprivacy/fuzzytags).
